His own playing career with Oulun's Kärpi came to an unexpected halt in spring 2014, but not before securing championship silver.</p><p>An operation on his wrist was meant to keep him off the rink for just a month, but complications extended his sick leave to over three months. Motivation waned as roster cuts took their toll. Arttu made a surprising decision - he'd stop if a medal came. Despite skepticism, he kept his word.</p><p>Transitioning to coaching after his playing days, Arttu couldn't resist returning to the action when the season started. He reached out to Juuso Pulliainen at 3Goals Promotion, offering to help. Soon, he found himself working with both younger and older players.</p><p>For Arttu, a Rovaniemi native spending his tenth winter in Oulu, genuine care for the player is paramount in an agent's role. Money shouldn't be the driving force; the player's well-being is the priority. Having recently hung up his own skates, Arttu understands players' desires firsthand.</p><p>His focus is on strategically positioning players for successful careers, considering the brevity of a hockey career. 'Believe in the player, don't give up in tough times. An agent is practically a lifelong presence,' Arttu emphasizes.</p>"
