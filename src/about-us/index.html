                    <p>Buckley Sports Management is a sports agency specializing in ice hockey. At the earliest stages of an agent-client relationship the goal is to provide timely, relevant, and insightful information to the client to help guide them toward the path that best suits their long-term goals, in both hockey and life.
                      </p>
                      <p>It is BSM's firm belief that in order to achieve long-term success as a professional athlete, all early career-related choices must be well thought-out. As a client progresses, Buckley Sports Management provides many hockey and non-hockey-related services including, but not limited to, draft preparation, contract negotiation, tax preparation and financial planning.
                      </p>
                      <p class="mb-0">In summary, Buckley Sports Management takes tremendous pride in providing complete, personal services which allow clients to focus their time and energy on playing hockey and reaching their career goals.</p>
